This project is developped by David González León, a Swiss IT Student.

The goal of this project is to create an application that allows the user to create and store information about his
fantasy/imaginary setting.

Development goals : currently my main goal is to finish developping the part that links the app with the database. The
next goal will be to create the UI interface for the application. Then I will start adding more functionalities, like
additional types of articles, and the ability for more than 1 person to see and/or work on a world at the same time.

The project is compiled using maven, and uses JavaFx for the ui, PostgreSQL for the database, and java I/O for the communication between the client and the server.
